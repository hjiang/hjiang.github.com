Hi, I am 江宏 (Jiang, Hong). This is my personal website.

I am leading the [China branch](http://team.mei.fm) of [AVOS](http://www.avos.com). Our products include [美味书签](http://meiweisq.com), [美味爱读](http://readwise.net), and [美味集](http://meiwei.fm).

From mid-2007 to mid-2010, I had been a software engineer at Google
(Mountain View) and worked on search infrastructure.

In 2007 I graduated with my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Yale
University](http://www.cs.yale.edu). Professor [Michael J. Fischer](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/fischer) was my advisor.
