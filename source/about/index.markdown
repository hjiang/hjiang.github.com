Hi, I am 江宏 (Jiang, Hong). This is my personal website.

I had co-founded two companies in the past. Now I am leading the China branch
of [AVOS](http://www.avos.com) to create [美味书签](http://mei.fm) which is a
[Delicious](http://delicious.com) product for the Chinese market.

From mid-2007 to mid-2010, I had been a software engineer at Google
(Mountain View) and worked on search infrastructure.

In 2007 I graduated with my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Yale
University](http://www.cs.yale.edu). Professor [Michael J. Fischer](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/fischer) was my advisor.
